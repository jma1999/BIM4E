# BIM4E
Building Information Modeling for Everyone
This research is aimed towards an idea I had for developing a pipeline which can get a user to a native .RVT (or any BIM software compatible file format) step-by-step; via this process, when a user describes a BIM model, they get an IFC file or an XML/gbXML file or a JSON file, which can be viewed in a browser-based platform, which has an in-built query section to talk to a GPT-based LLM which is trained to understand natrual language inputs and map them to corresponding BIM outputs. There will be a 3D viewer to view and interact with the outputted file. From there, I envision a workflow which lets a user who is trained in 3d modeling and BIM (like an architect, or an MEP engineer) to be able to download the file in the format of their choice for the BIM environment fo their choice - Revit (.rvt), Rhinoceros (.rh), eQUEST (.eps), etc. so that they can make detailed changes to it, and design with it.
