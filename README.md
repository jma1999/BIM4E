**Building Information Modeling for Everyone**

This research is aimed towards an idea I had for developing a pipeline which can get a user to a native .RVT (or any BIM software compatible file format) using just NLP. The vision is to do for BIM what GPT-LLMs have done for coding; via this process, when a user describes a BIM model, they get an IFC file or an XML/gbXML file or a JSON file, which can be viewed in a browser-based platform, which has an in-built query section to talk to a GPT-based LLM which is trained to understand natural language inputs and map them to corresponding BIM outputs. There will be a 3D viewer to view and interact with the outputted file. From there, I envision a workflow which lets a user who is trained in 3d modeling and BIM (like an architect, or an MEP engineer) to be able to download the file in the format of their choice for the BIM environment fo their choice - Revit (.rvt), Rhinoceros (.rh), eQUEST (.eps), etc. so that they can make detailed changes to it, and design with it. I think the way forward is to incorporate/train/hypertune an existing LLM like GPT-4o, or Claude 3.7 Sonnet, or Gemini 2.0, (or whichever model works best for this task) to be able to understand BIM, it's components, classes, file types, formats, etc. and also to make the necessary API calls required for making Revit and other native file types; this way, I wouldn't be competing with experts that work on great language models (that I do not have the intellectual bandwidth to make on my own), instead, be working with their advancements in the field in order to achieve my vision.
